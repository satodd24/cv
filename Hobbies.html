<p>It's a maddening game, but I love it.  It amazes me how different my performance can be from one round to the next.</p>

<h3><a id="Bodybuilding">Bodybuilding</a></h3>
<p>My first passion.  I've been intrigued by weightlifting and fitness since I was around 8 years old.  It wasn't until I was in my 20s and working as a personal trainer that I got 
    into bodybuilding.</p>
